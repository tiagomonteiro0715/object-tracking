The motivation behind this project was to gain a better understanding of tensorflow 2.4 and to serve as an example for future projects of the same type. 

Essencially, it takes a dataset of images builds a model that classifies brain images with and without cancer. I used tensorflow because it was, in my point of view, the best machine lerning framework for programming enthusiasts in this subfield.

Not only I lerned alot about this framework, but also learned in a pratical way machine lerning. This projects standout by the code being writeen in a way that is easy to understand. And also creates a model that is easy and intuitive  to use.

Install dependencies:

Upgrade pip and install virtualenv

```
pip install --upgrade --user pip

pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```

Create and activate the virtual enviroment.The python version already needs to be installed in your pc

I am using this python version because at the moment this python version is  compatible with tensorflow and keras

```
virtualenv -p python3 envname
```
Activate it:

```
cd envname/Scripts

activate
```

Install necessary modules and activate it

```
pip install opencv-python

```
